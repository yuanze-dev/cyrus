/**
 * Per-platform default allowed-tool lists.
 *
 * These are the single source of truth for "what tools does Cyrus have access
 * to when a session is triggered by platform X". cyrus-hosted and any
 * self-host configuration imports these constants verbatim; the database
 * stores per-team overrides only, and falls back to these lists when a team
 * has not customized its allowed-tool set.
 *
 * Resolution is **additive only** — there is no implicit appending of
 * workspace MCP tools at runtime. Anything Cyrus needs (including
 * `mcp__linear`, `mcp__cyrus-tools`, `mcp__cyrus-docs`, `mcp__slack`, and
 * read access to repository paths) is listed here explicitly. If you remove
 * a tool from this list, Cyrus loses access to it. If you add a tool here,
 * existing teams whose column equals the previous verbatim default will be
 * migrated forward; teams who have customized their list are left alone.
 *
 * The three lists are intentionally maintained independently — sharing tools
 * between platforms is fine and expected, but the lists do not derive from
 * each other.
